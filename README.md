# Roadents 

## What It Is

Roadents is an API toolset for better interacting with public transit systems. 
It is divided up into multiple tools, or "Cores", each with a set, defined purpose:

*  ```Badger``` -- Finds points of interest that allow for a round-trip time lower than a certain threshold; for example, it can find restaurants around an office so the user can get back in time for their next meeting.
*  ```Weasel``` -- Finds points of interest where the travel time is lower than a certain threshold for multiple start points, like if 2 friends are meeting for lunch.
*  ```Mole```   -- Finds points of interest that let the user start at a given A and reach a given B by a certain time, like trying to find a coffee place on the way to school to get coffee.
*  ```Revdonut``` (to be renamed) -- Finds points of interest that let a user reach a location by a given time, like finding an appartment that lets you have a short commute to your morning classes.
